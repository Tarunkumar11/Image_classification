In  this project we are going to classify the image.I am using the Intel_image dataset which contain 6 different classes-
1:  Bulding.
2:  Forest.
3:  Glacier.
4:  Mountain.
5:  Sea.
6:  Street.
here we use the Mobile_net a pretrained model. And trained this model on Intel_image data to get result.
